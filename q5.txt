1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
- The change inside the function does not remain after the function call because the parameter that is passed into the function is an object but its value change in the function does not affect the value outside of it.
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
- The change inside the function remains after the function call because the parameter that is passed into the function is a reference.
3. If they differ answer why? If not why not?
- They differ in answers because the parameter of the first function is an object while the parameter of the second function is a reference.

1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
- The change inside the function does not remain after the function call because the parameter that is passed into the function is a value type therefore its value change in the function does not affect the value outside of it.
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
- The change inside the function remains after the function call because the parameter that is passed into the function is a reference.
3. If they differ answer why? If not why not?
- They differ in answers because the parameter of the first function is a value type while the parameter of the second function is a reference. The reference values can be manipulated inside a function like a global variable, however value types can't be due to its limited scope only inside of a function, meaning the history of value change only remains inside a function but does not linger once getting out from the function call.
